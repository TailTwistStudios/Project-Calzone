## Design Philosophy
1. Users need not understand the inner workings of the software in order to be able to use it.
2. The software should provide explanation when something goes wrong.
3. The project should be as self contained as possible and avoid using tools and libraries that unnessecarily complicate it's maintanance.
4. No update shall be released without reasonable effort to update official documentation beforehand. Documentation updates should be considered a core part of updating the software.
5. The project should prioritize open source or otherwise freely distributable libraries over proprietary ones.
6. If a paid or proprietary library must be used, then if at all possible; the project should be organized as to not tie itself to one proprietary product.
